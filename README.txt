SERVERS
Monitor your servers and get notified of issues before they are happening. Get a real-time and historical overview of what is happening on your server and set notifications for when something isn't going as expected.

WEBSITES
Don't rely on your users to get notified of issues on your websites. Monitor your websites automatically for uptime, ssl expiration, mixed content and broken links.
